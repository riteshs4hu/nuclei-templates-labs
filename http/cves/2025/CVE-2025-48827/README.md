# CVE-2025-48827: vBulletin - Authentication Bypass

## Description:
vBulletin 5.0.0 through 5.7.5 and 6.0.0 through 6.0.3 allows unauthenticated users to invoke protected API controllers' methods when running on PHP 8.1 or later, as demonstrated by the /api.php?method=protectedMethod pattern, as exploited in the wild in May 2025.

- https://blog.kevintel.com/vbulletin-replaceadtemplate-kev/

## Vulnerable Setup:

- Unzip html.zip 

- Execute the following commands to start a vBulletin:

```
docker compose up -d
```

- After the server is started and database is restored, browse to http://localhost:8081/ for php 8.1 version.


## Exploitation Steps:

- The authentication bypass can be triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/ajax/api/ad/wrapAdTemplate` endpoint with arbitrary values for the template and `id_name` parameters (e.g., template=uxdml&id_name=oszde), allowing unauthenticated users to invoke protected ad-related methods in vulnerable vBulletin instances running on PHP 8.1 or later.
